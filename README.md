# A-Review-of-Common-Practices-for-Malware-Unpacking
The study of packers and their impact on software security and cyber-attacks is crucial for understanding the techniques employed by both malicious actors and legitimate software developers. This thesis aims to provide an exploration of packers, including their mechanisms, functionality, and implications for software analysis.

The primary objective of this thesis is to analyze and evaluate different packer techniques, dissecting their inner workings and investigating the challenges they pose to traditional security analysis approaches. By examining various packers' features, we seek to increase our understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and potential mitigations. Furthermore, this thesis aims to propose a possible strategy to analyze advanced packers by exploring innovative approaches.
